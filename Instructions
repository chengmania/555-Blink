Steps

Collect all the required components and place the 555 timer IC on the breadboard.

Connect pin 1 of a 555 timer IC to the ground. You can find the pin structure of a 555 timer IC in the circuit diagram shown above.

The longer lead of a polarized capacitor is the positive and the shorter lead is negative. Connect pin 2 to the positive end of a capacitor. 
Connect the negative lead of the capacitor to the ground of the battery.

Now short the pin 2 to pin 6 of the 555 timer IC.

Connect the output pin 3 with the positive lead of the LED using a 1kΩ resistor. The negative lead of LED needs to be connected with the ground.

Connect pin 4 to the positive end of the battery.

Pin 5 does not connect to anything.

Connect pin 6 to pin 7 using a 100kΩ resistor.

Connect pin 7 to the positive end of the battery using a 1kΩ resistor.

Connect pin 8 to the positive end of the battery.

Finally, connect the battery leads with the breadboard to start the power supply in the circuit.
